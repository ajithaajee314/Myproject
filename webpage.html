	<p>A planet is a large astronomical body that is neither a star nor a stellar remnant. At least eight planets exist in the Solar System: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The word probably comes from the Greek plan?tai, meaning "wanderers", which in antiquity referred to the Sun, Moon, and five bodies visible as points of light that moved across the background of the stars.</p>
